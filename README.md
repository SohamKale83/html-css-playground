# ðŸŽ¨ HTML & CSS Playground

Welcome to my **HTML & CSS Playground**!  

This repository is a collection of my mini-projects and experiments with HTML and CSS, featuring animations, interactive UI elements, and creative design effects. Each project is self-contained, making it easy to explore, learn from, and experiment with.  

Fellow developers and enthusiasts are encouraged to dive in, explore the code, and even adapt these projects for their own personal creations or experiments. Whether youâ€™re looking to learn, get inspired, or just have fun with CSS, this playground has something for you!   

You can click on any project below to see it **live in action** (if using GitHub Pages) or view the code directly.
